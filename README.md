# Electronic-Voting-System
Introduction
The Decentralized Electronic Voting System is a cutting-edge solution that addresses the challenges of traditional voting systems. By utilizing blockchain, we aim to eliminate issues related to voter fraud, tampering, and lack of transparency. This repository contains the source code and resources needed to understand, deploy, and contribute to the project.

Features
Decentralization: The voting system is built on a decentralized network, ensuring no single point of failure and enhancing resilience against attacks.

Transparency: Every step of the voting process, from voter registration to ballot counting, is recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent audit trail.

Security: Advanced cryptographic techniques are employed to secure the system, safeguarding voter identities and vote confidentiality.

Tamper-Proof: Once a vote is cast, it is cryptographically sealed and stored on the blockchain, making it nearly impossible for malicious actors to alter or manipulate the results.

Accessibility: The system is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to voters of all technical backgrounds
